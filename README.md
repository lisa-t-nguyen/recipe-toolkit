# Why Build This?
Being a cook myself, I wanted my first solo-project to be something oriented around one of my hobbies. I absolutely love cooking and getting inspiration from recipes other than my own. I believed this would be a great challenge after learning how to implement the initial CRUD operations from my Code Journal project.
